The Gemini clone is a React-based web application designed to replicate the original interface, enabling users to input prompts and receive answers in real time. Built with React, HTML, and CSS, the application features a sleek and intuitive UI that closely resembles the original Gemini design. Users can seamlessly interact by entering queries, which generate instant responses, and a built-in history feature stores past prompts and answers for easy reference. This project demonstrates a strong focus on recreating a modern, user-friendly experience while showcasing efficient state management and dynamic rendering capabilities.
